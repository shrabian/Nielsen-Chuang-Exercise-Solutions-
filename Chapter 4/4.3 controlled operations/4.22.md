## 4.22

Note that the phase operator has been omitted from all illustrations for simplicity, however they will be included in the total gate count.

![Initial](../imgs/4.22.png)
Putting figure 4.6 and 4.8 from the textbook together, we arrive at the unsimplified circuit shown above. Including phase gates, there are 12 single qubit gates and 8 $`CNOT`$ gates. The first and most obvious simplification we can make is to cancel out adjacent inverse unitaries circled in red, which lowers the single qubit gate count to 8 as required.

![Second](../imgs/4.22.2.png)
The final step is to simplify the two $`CNOT`$ triplets circled in red above. We see that the truth table of the first is given by:

| q0 | q1 | q2 | q0' | q1' | q2' |
|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

which is equal to the circuit

and the second is given by:

| q0 | q1 | q2 | q0' | q1' | q2' |
|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

which is equal to the circuit

The final circuit is depicted below. Note that there are 8 single qubit gates and 6 $`CNOT`$ gates as required.
