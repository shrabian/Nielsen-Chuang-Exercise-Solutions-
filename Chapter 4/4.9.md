I learned this solution from\
https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/5199/general-parametrisation-of-an-arbitrary-2-times-2-unitary-matrix. It took me a long time to understand the proposed solution so my explanation will be verbose.

A single qubit unitary is a 2x2 matrix of complex numbers whose rows and columns each form sets of orthonormal vectors. We'll examine the components of this description sequentially and observe how it impacts our construction.

#### **Complex matrix**
Any 2x2 complex matrix may be described
$$
U=
\begin{pmatrix}
r_1e^{ia} & r_2e^{ib}\\
r_2e^{ic} & r_4e^{id}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Where $r_1...r_4, a...d$ are reals. This forms our starting point.

#### **Normality**
Each row and column of $U$ must be a unit vector. To begin with consider the first row:
$$
r_1e^{ia}(r_1e^{ia})^* + r_2e^{ib}(r_2e^{ib})^*=1
\rightarrow r_1^2+r_2^2=1
$$
so WOLG rewrite $r_1=\cos(\gamma/2), r_2=\sin(\gamma/2)$. We can apply similar logic to the second row of $U$ but we have to make sure that the columns are also normalised. This can be satisfied for our current selection of $r_1$ and $r_2$ by choosing $r_3 = \sin(\gamma/2)$ and $r_4=\cos(\gamma/2)$. In all,
$$
U = 
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{ia}\cos(\gamma/2) & e^{ib}\sin(\gamma/2)\\
e^{ic}\sin(\gamma/2) & e^{id}\cos(\gamma/2)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### **Orthogonality**
Each row (column) must be orthogonal to all other rows (columns).
$$
e^{i(a-c)}\cos(\gamma/2)\sin(\gamma/2)+e^{i(b-d)}\cos(\gamma/2)\sin(\gamma/2)=0\\
\rightarrow e^{i(a-c)}\cos(\gamma/2)\sin(\gamma/2) = e^{i(b-d+\pi)}\cos(\gamma/2)\sin(\gamma/2)
$$
One way to always satisfy this restriction without losing generality is by letting $a=b+c-d+\pi$ such that $e^{i(a-c)}=e^{i(b-d+\pi)}$. As a subtle point, this is true even in the case where $\gamma\in \{0, \pi, 2\pi, 3\pi ...\}$ and $\cos(\gamma/2)\sin(\gamma/2)=0$ because in this case, either $\sin(\gamma/2)=0$ and we can choose any $b$ and $c$, or $\cos(\gamma/2)=0$ and we can choose any $a$ to satisfy $a=b+c-d+\pi$. Hence,
$$
U=
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i(b+c-d+\pi)}\cos(\gamma/2) & e^{ib}\sin(\gamma/2)\\
e^{ic}\sin(\gamma/2) & e^{id}\cos(\gamma/2)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### **Reparameterising**
To convert our unitary to the form given in theorem 4.1 we simply rewrite
$$
\begin{align}
& b= \alpha-\beta/2+\delta/2+\pi\\
& c= \alpha+\beta/2-\delta/2\\
& d=\alpha+\beta/2+\delta/2
\end{align}
$$
noting that $a=b+c-d+\pi=\alpha-\beta/2-\delta/2+2\pi$. Why is this reparameterisation valid? The claim we are making is that there exists values for $\alpha, \beta$ and $\delta$ such that any triplet $(b,c,d)\in\mathbb{R}^3$ can be expressed by the system of linear equations given by $(1), (2)$ and $(3)$. But this is equivalent to saying the *vector* $(b-\pi,c,d)^T$ can be written as a linear combination of $\alpha, \beta$ and $\delta$ and the vector of factors in front of each:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
b-\pi\\
c\\
d
\end{pmatrix}
=\alpha
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
+ \beta/2
\begin{pmatrix}
-1\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
+\delta/2
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
-1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Formally, our claim is that $\{(1,1,1)^T, 1/2(-1,1,1)^T, 1/2(1,-1,1)^T\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is true since we can easily show the set to be linearly independent. In all we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
&U=
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i(\alpha-\beta/2-\delta/2+2\pi)}\cos(\gamma/2) & e^{i(\alpha-\beta/2+\delta/2+\pi)}\sin(\gamma/2)\\
e^{i(\alpha+\beta/2-\delta/2)}\sin(\gamma/2) & e^{i(\alpha+\beta/2+\delta/2)}\cos(\gamma/2)
\end{pmatrix}\\
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i(\alpha-\beta/2-\delta/2)}\cos(\gamma/2) & -e^{i(\alpha-\beta/2+\delta/2)}\sin(\gamma/2)\\
e^{i(\alpha+\beta/2-\delta/2)}\sin(\gamma/2) & e^{i(\alpha+\beta/2+\delta/2)}\cos(\gamma/2)
\end{pmatrix}\\
& =
e^{i\alpha}R_z(\beta)R_y(\gamma)R_z(\delta)
\end{align*}
$$

#### **Further Reading**
Another peripheral point to mention is the difference between unitary and special unitary matrices. A special unitary is a unitary matrix with determinant 1. Any special unitary can be written $V = e^{-i\alpha}U$ where $U$ is unitary and has determinant $e^{i\alpha}$. From our previous work we know we can write $U=e^{ix}R_z(\beta)R_y(\gamma)R_z(\delta)$. Since $e^{i\alpha}=\det(e^{ix}R_z(\beta)R_y(\gamma)R_z(\delta))=e^{ix}, x=\alpha$ and $V=R_z(\beta)R_y(\gamma)R_z(\delta)$ This info and a little bit more was gleamed from the following links:\
