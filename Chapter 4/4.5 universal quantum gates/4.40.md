## 4.40

Before reading this page I strongly recommend reading the revisions I made to the proof for approximating phase factors to arbitrary appoximation [here](../cheekycheats/revisedUniversality1.md). This solution is based on the insights provided by user dylan7 and DaftWullie in the following post:\
https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/10269/error-bound-on-approximating-arbitrary-rotation-gates

First we show $`E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha + \beta))=\left|1-e^{i\beta/2}\right|`$.
```math
\begin{align*}
&E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha + \beta))=\max_{\ket{\psi}}||R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha)(I - R_{\hat{n}}(\beta))\ket{\psi}||\\

&=\max_{\ket{\psi}}\sqrt{\bra{\psi}(I - R_{\hat{n}}(- \beta))(I- R_{\hat{n}}(\beta))\ket{\psi}} \\

&=\max_{\ket{\psi}}\sqrt{\bra{\psi}(2I-R_{\hat{n}}(\beta) - R_{\hat{n}}(-\beta))\ket{\psi}}=\sqrt{2-2\cos(\beta/2)}\\

&=\sqrt{2-e^{i\beta/2}-e^{-i\beta/2}}=\sqrt{(1-e^{-i\beta/2})(1-e^{i\beta/2})}\\

&=\left|1-e^{i\beta/2}\right|
\end{align*}
```
We now move on to the proof of equation 4.73 in the text book, but in light of the error in exercise 4.11, we will modify the equation slightly as follows. 
```math
E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\theta)^n)<\epsilon/c
```
for integer $`c>0`$.
As a first step, rewrite the LHS of the inequality as follows:
```math
\begin{align*}
&E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\theta)^n)=E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(n\theta \mod 4\pi))\\
&=E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha + (n\theta \mod 4\pi) - \alpha))
\end{align*}
```
where we have used the fact that $`R_{\hat{n}}(x)=R_{\hat{n}}(x \mod 4\pi)`$ and will further use it to assume that $`\alpha \in [0,4\pi)`$ WOLG. It follows from our earlier work that 
```math
\begin{align*}
&E(R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha), R_{\hat{n}}(\theta)^n) < \epsilon/c\\
&\iff \left|1-\exp(i((n\theta \mod 4\pi) - \alpha)/2)\right|< \epsilon/c\\
&\iff \left|1-\exp(i((n\theta \mod 4\pi) - \alpha)/2)\right| < |1-e^{i\delta/2}|\\
&\iff (n\theta \mod{4\pi}) - \alpha < \delta
\end{align*}
```
for some appropriate chosen $`\delta`$. Based on part one of my revised proof of universality (linked above), we know that there exists a positive integer $`n`$ that satisfies the above so long as $`\delta > 0`$. Therefore, all we are required to find is a satisfactory $`\delta`$.

Suppose $`\epsilon/c = |1-e^{i\delta/2}|`$ for some delta

```math
\epsilon/c =|1-e^{i\delta/2}|= \sqrt{2(1-\cos(\delta/2))} = 2\sin(\delta/4) \approx \delta/2
```
where the third equality comes from the double angle formula: $`1-\cos(x) = 2\sin(x/2)`$, and the fourth equation comes from the small angle approximation: $`\sin(x) \approx x \mod{2\pi}`$ for small $`\sin(x)`$. Setting $`\delta = 2\epsilon/c`$ completes the proof.

It follows that we can approximate any rotation $`R_{\hat{n}}(\alpha)`$ using repeated applications of $`R_{\hat{n}}(\theta)`$ up to an arbitrary accuracy and you may now find it instructive to read part two of my revised proof of universality, found [here](../cheekycheats/revisedUniversality2.md) which uses this result to show that any single qubit gate can be approximated using $`H`$ and $`T`$ gates.
