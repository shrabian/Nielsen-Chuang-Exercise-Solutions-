Recall that the arbitrary state $`\ket{\psi} = \cos(\theta/2)\ket{0} + e^{i\varphi}\sin(\theta/2)\ket{1}`$, corresponds to the point $`(\cos(\varphi)\sin(\theta), \sin(\varphi)\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta))`$ on the bloch sphere.

The eigenvectors of the $`Z`$ gate are $`\ket{0}`$ and $`\ket{1}`$. For $`\ket{0}`$, $`\theta = 0`$ so the corresponding point on the bloch sphere is $`(0,0,1)`$. For $`\ket{1}`$, $`\theta = \pi`$ and $`\varphi = 0`$ corresponding to the point $`(0,0,-1)`$.

The eigenvectors of $`X`$ are $`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1})`$ and $`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1})`$. For the first, $`\theta = \pi/2`$ and $`\varphi = 0`$ so its point is $`(1,0,0)`$. The second is given by $`\theta = \pi/2`$ and $`\varphi = \pi`$ so its point is $`(-1,0,0)`$.

The eigenvectors of $`Y`$ are $`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+i\ket{1})`$ and $`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}-i\ket{1})`$. For the first, $`\theta = \pi/2`$ and $`\varphi = \pi/2`$ so its point is $`(0,1,0)`$. For the second, $`\theta=\pi/2`$ and $`\varphi = 3\pi/2`$ so its point is $`(0,-1,0)`$.
